# AWS SQS Source for Numaflow

The AWS SQS Source is a custom user-defined source for [Numaflow](https://numaflow.numaproj.io/) that enables the integration of Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) as a source within your Numaflow pipelines.

## Quick Start
This quick start guide will walk you through setting up an AWS SQS source in a Numaflow pipeline.

### Prerequisites
* [Install Numaflow on your Kubernetes cluster](https://numaflow.numaproj.io/quick-start/)
* AWS CLI configured with access to AWS SQS

### Step-by-step Guide

#### 1. Create an AWS SQS Queue

Using AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console, create a new SQS queue.

#### 2. Deploy a Numaflow Pipeline with AWS SQS Source

Save the following Kubernetes manifest to a file (e.g., `sqs-source-pipeline.yaml`), modifying the AWS region, queue name, and AWS credentials accordingly:

```yaml
apiVersion: numaflow.numaproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: sqs-source-pipeline
spec:
  vertices:
    - name: sqs-source
      source:
        udsource:
          container:
            image: your-repo/aws-sqs-source-go:v1.0.0
            env:
              - name: AWS_REGION
                value: "us-east-1"
              - name: AWS_QUEUE
                value: "your-sqs-queue-name"
              - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: aws-credentials
                    key: accessKeyId
              - name: AWS_SECRET
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: aws-credentials
                    key: secretAccessKey
    - name: log-sink
      sink:
        log: {}
  edges:
    - from: sqs-source
      to: log-sink
```

Then apply it to your cluster:
```bash
kubectl apply -f sqs-source-pipeline.yaml
```

#### 3. Verify the Pipeline

Check if the pipeline is running:
```bash
kubectl get pipeline sqs-source-pipeline
```

#### 4. Send Messages to the AWS SQS Queue

Using the AWS CLI, send a message to your SQS queue:
```bash
aws sqs send-message --queue-url <YourQueueUrl> --message-body "Hello from SQS"
```

#### 5. Verify the Log Sink

Check the logs of the `log-sink` vertex to see if it received the message from SQS:
```bash
kubectl logs <log-sink-pod-name>
```

You should see output similar to:
```
Message received: Hello from SQS
```

#### 6. Clean up

To delete the Numaflow pipeline:
```bash
kubectl delete pipeline sqs-source-pipeline
```

To delete the SQS queue:
```bash
aws sqs delete-queue --queue-url <YourQueueUrl>
```

Congratulations! You have successfully set up an AWS SQS source in a Numaflow pipeline.

## How to Use the AWS SQS Source in Your Own Numaflow Pipeline

**Prerequisites:**
- Ensure Numaflow is installed on your Kubernetes cluster.
- Your AWS CLI should be configured to access AWS SQS.

**Step-by-step Guide:**

1. **Create an AWS SQS Queue:**
    - Use the AWS CLI or log in to the AWS Management Console to create a new SQS queue.

2. **Deploy a Numaflow Pipeline with AWS SQS Source:**
    - Prepare a Kubernetes manifest file, letâ€™s say `sqs-source-pipeline.yaml`. Here's a template to get you started:

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: numaflow.numaproj.io/v1alpha1
      kind: Pipeline
      metadata:
        name: sqs-source-pipeline
      spec:
        vertices:
          - name: sqs-source
            source:
              udsource:
                container:
                  image: your-repo/aws-sqs-source-go:v1.0.0
                  env:
                    - name: AWS_REGION
                      value: "us-east-1"
                    - name: AWS_QUEUE
                      value: "your-sqs-queue-name"
                    - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY
                      valueFrom:
                        secretKeyRef:
                          name: aws-credentials
                          key: accessKeyId
                    - name: AWS_SECRET
                      valueFrom:
                        secretKeyRef:
                          name: aws-credentials
                          key: secretAccessKey
          - name: log-sink
            sink:
              log: {}
        edges:
          - from: sqs-source
            to: log-sink
      ```

    - Modify the image path, AWS region, queue name, and AWS credentials as per your configuration.
    - Apply the configuration to your cluster by running:

      ```bash
      kubectl apply -f sqs-source-pipeline.yaml
      ```

By following these steps, you'll have an AWS SQS queue as a source for your Numaflow pipeline running in Kubernetes. Messages from the SQS queue will be fetched by the pipeline and passed to the log sink, where they can be processed as per your pipeline logic.

## Using JSON Format to Specify the AWS SQS Source Configuration

While YAML is the default configuration format, the AWS SQS source also supports JSON. See the section [Using JSON format to specify the AWS SQS source configuration](#using-json-format-to-specify-the-aws-sqs-source-configuration) for examples and guidance.

## Using Environment Variables to Specify the AWS SQS Source Configuration

To configure the AWS SQS source in your Numaflow pipeline using environment variables, you can follow this process:

**Using Environment Variables for AWS SQS Source Configuration:**

1. **Set up Environment Variables:**
   - Define environment variables on your Kubernetes deployment to hold the necessary AWS SQS configuration such as the region, queue name, and credentials.
   - For example, you can set `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_QUEUE`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SECRET` as environment variables in your pipeline deployment.

2. **Modify Your Pipeline Configuration:**
   - In your Numaflow pipeline definition (`sqs-source-pipeline.yaml`), you will reference these environment variables. Ensure your source container in the pipeline specification is configured to use these variables.

Here's an example snippet for your Kubernetes manifest file:

```yaml
apiVersion: numaflow.numaproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: sqs-source-pipeline
spec:
  vertices:
    - name: sqs-source
      source:
        udsource:
          container:
            image: your-repo/aws-sqs-source-go:v1.0.0
            env:
              - name: AWS_REGION
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: aws-env-variables
                    key: region
              - name: AWS_QUEUE
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: aws-env-variables
                    key: queueName
              - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: aws-env-variables
                    key: accessKeyID
              - name: AWS_SECRET
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: aws-env-variables
                    key: secretAccessKey
```

3. **Deploy the Configuration:**
   - Apply the updated pipeline configuration to your Kubernetes cluster using the command:

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f sqs-source-pipeline.yaml
     ```

By configuring your pipeline in this manner, it allows the AWS SQS source to dynamically retrieve the configuration from the environment variables, making it easier to manage credentials and configuration changes.



To enable debugging, set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `true` within the AWS SQS source container. This will output additional log messages for troubleshooting.
